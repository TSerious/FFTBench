# FFTBench
Compares different FFT implementations

Thanks to Christian Woltering and his arcticle "Comparison of FFT Implementations for .NET" [https://www.codeproject.com/articles/1095473/comparison-of-fft-implementations-for-net] which is the base for this project.

Further thanks to PeterPet and his FFTS project [https://github.com/PetterPet01/FFTSSharp] which is also part of this project.

## Usage
Open the solution, compile and start the FFTBench project.
